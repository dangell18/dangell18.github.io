        French & German
    </h3>

    <div class="home">
        <p>
            “French and German” people descend from ancient Alpine-Celtic and Germanic populations, 
            and inhabit an area extending from the Netherlands to Austria – roughly corresponding to 
            the extent of Charlemagne’s Frankish Kingdom in the Middle Ages. Estimates place Charlemagne 
            himself in the family trees of all modern Europeans, possibly many times over. Genetically and 
            geographically, the French and Germans are at the heart of Europe.<br><br>

            French & German people have lived at a crossroads in human migration for millennia, and their 
            genetics reflect that history. Celtic languages and culture first appeared in Central Europe, 
            extending from the British Isles to the Black sea by the 3rd century BCE. But the rise of 
            the Roman Empire spelled the downfall of a Celtic-speaking Europe, and today, Celtic languages 
            can only be found along the far western periphery of their former territory.<br><br>

            With the Western Roman Empire in decline, Germanic tribes conquered vast territories from the 
            North Sea to North Africa. Although Germanic languages did not replace the Latin-based languages 
            spoken in what is now France and Belgium, recent studies found evidence that the migrations of 
            Germanic peoples from the 4th to the 6th centuries had a more significant impact on Europe’s 
            DNA than did the earlier expansion of the Roman Empire.

        British & Irish

        <p>
            The British Isles have been continuously occupied by humans for the last 11,000 years, but more 
            recently, the people of the Isles have left their genetic fingerprints around the world, following 
            centuries of nautical exploration, colonization, and immigration. In the early 20th century, the 
            Republic of Ireland won its independence from the United Kingdom, but the people of these nations 
            share a common genetic heritage rooted largely in Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, and Viking migrations from 
            northwestern Europe.<br><br>

            In a recent landmark project (called “People of the British Isles”), researchers identified a number 
            of distinct genetic clusters within the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, all strongly 
            correlated with regional borders. As the researchers increased the resolution of their analysis, 
            the first unique cluster to separate from the rest of the UK was the Orkney Islands off the 
            northeastern coast of Scotland, followed by Wales. At a much higher resolution, the study was able 
            to uncover a genetic boundary between neighboring Cornwall and Devon in the southwestern tip of 
            England (which may come as no surprise to the people of these counties, who observe radically 
            different culinary routines: in Devon, clotted cream is applied to scones first, before the jam. 
            In Cornwall, it’s the opposite).
